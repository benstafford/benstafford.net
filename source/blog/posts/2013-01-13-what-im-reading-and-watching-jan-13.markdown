#### Books

##### Fiction
[*A Deepness in the Sky* by Vernor Vinge](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002H8ORKM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=benstaffordne-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B002H8ORKM") - I read A Fire Upon the Deep (first in the Zones of Thought series) and enjoyed it quite a bit.  Just good science fiction - the kind that takes a bit to wrap your head around.

[*The Colour of Magic* by Terry Pratchett](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W9399S/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=benstaffordne-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000W9399S) - Always heard good things about Terry Pratchett, but have never read anything from him, so figured that I would start with he first book of the Discworld Series.

[*Muddle Earth* by Paul Stewart and Chris Riddell](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0330538764/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=benstaffordne-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0330538764) - My son read this one and giggled constantly.  A fun spoof of Lord of the Rings with great kids-oriented comedy - complete with pink stinky hogs that break wind.

#### Movies/TV

Battlestar Galactica - Still working through the series...

Sherlock (BBC) - Both my wife and I enjoyed the first two seasons of Sherlock (with Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman).  A fun modern take on Sherlock Holmes.
